# Loan-Prediction
Aim:

The main aim of this project is to predict the loan eligibility of a person.

To predict the loan data by using some machine learning algorithms they are logistic regression,Decision Tree.,etc.

Attributes in the dataset:

Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount,Credit History, Property_Area, Loan_Status.

Methodology:

Data requirements: It is a very vital role of a data analyst to check for the requirements of the data. What actually they need and what not?

Data collection: Collecting data is also a important part of the same as we need structred data and with minimal amount of anomolies.

Data understanding: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done on the given data to see for the features that are most important and also check for errors.

Data preparation: After cleaning process we prepare the data for model development.

Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of different machine learning algorithm to check which algorithm best fits the model and which does not.

Evaluation: After model development we check the performance metrics and do validation and also checks for the accuracy which produces more accurate results.

Tools & Technology used:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Python libraries: pandas,matplotlib,seaborn&scikit-learn
Exploratory data Analysis on the features of this dataset and saw how each feature is distributed.


Each variable to check if data is cleaned and normally distributed.

The data Cleaned and removed NA values.


In general, it can be seen that all models can achieve up to 70% accuracy.
ðŸ‘‰ The highest accuracy is 92%.
